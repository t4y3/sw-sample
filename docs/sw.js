 * DO NOT EDIT THE FILE MANIFEST ENTRY

 * The method precache() does the following:
 * 1. Cache URLs in the manifest to a local cache.
 * 2. When a network request is made for any of these URLs the response
 *    will ALWAYS comes from the cache, NEVER the network.
 * 3. When the service worker changes ONLY assets with a revision change are
 *    updated, old cache entries are left as is.
 *
 * By changing the file manifest manually, your users may end up not receiving
 * new versions of files because the revision hasn't changed.
 *
 * Please use workbox-build or some other tool / approach to generate the file
 * manifest which accounts for changes to local files and update the revision
 * accordingly.
